# Use the upstream fork for self-hosting Habitica instead!

Link to the upstream fork: https://github.com/awinterstein/habitica

For some silly SEO reason, my outdated subfork seems to be getting prioritized instead of this better maintained parent fork.

**Avoid using this repository for self-hosting and instead use the link shared above if you're looking to self-host Habitica!**

# Habitica Self-Hosted

Adaptions and infrastructure to facilitate self-hosting of the habit-building program [Habitica](https://habitica.com). It is based on the source code and assets of the [Habitica Repository](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica), hence the [LICENSE](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica/blob/develop/LICENSE) from there applies here and to the adaptions in this repository as well.

For each release in the Habitica upstream repository, the self-hosting adaptions are automatically applied by rebasing the `self-host` branch onto the last release commit. The Docker images for server and client are built then and pushed to Docker Hub as [awinterstein/habitica-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/awinterstein/habitica-server) and [awinterstein/habitica-client](https://hub.docker.com/r/awinterstein/habitica-client).

## Improvements for Self-Hosting

The following noteworthy changes were applied to the Habitica source code:

- Dockerfile and Github Workflow to create the production containers for hosting
- every user automatically gets a subscription on registration that never needs to be renewed
- first registered used automatically gets admin rights
- locations for buying gems with money were replaced with options to buy with gold (e.g., the quick access in the header)
- group plans can be created without payment
- emails are sent directly via a configured SMTP server instead of using the Mailchimp (Mandrill) web-service
- settings and links (e.g., in the footer) that do not make sense for a self-hosted site were removed
- registrations can be restricted to only invited users via a configuration parameter
- analytics and payment scripts are not loaded

## Limitations

The following things do not work (yet):

- dailies for group plans are not reset (the actual cron script [team-cron.js](scripts/team-cron.js) would need to be executed regularly for this)
- third-party access and scripts are not thoroughly disabled, so there might still be some scripts loaded

Contributions to fix those or other things are very welcome!

## Simple Setup with Docker Compose

Habitica needs a Mongo database, its server component (a NodeJS application) and its client component (a Vue.js application). In the simplest setup for self-hosting, there are three containers started for them, with a dependency from the client to the server to the database:

```mermaid
architecture-beta
    group containers(server)[Containers]

    service db(database)[MongoDB] in containers
    service server(server)[Server] in containers
    service client(server)[Client] in containers

    db:L <-- R:server
    client:R--> L:server

    group host(server)[Host]
    service proxy(server)[Reverse Proxy] in host

    proxy{group}:T --> B:client{group}
```

The client port could directly be exposed as port 80 on the host. However, usually a reverse proxy like Nginx would be put in front, that handles HTTPS traffic including TLS certificate handling.

The following Docker Compose file can be used for setting up the containers:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  server:
    image: docker.io/awinterstein/habitica-server:latest
    depends_on:
      - mongo
    environment:
      - NODE_DB_URI=mongodb://mongo/habitica # this only needs to be adapted if using a separate database
      - BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 # change this to the URL under which your instance will be reachable
      - INVITE_ONLY=false # change to `true` after registration of initial users, to restrict further registrations
      - EMAIL_SERVER_URL=mail.example.com
      - EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=587
      - EMAIL_SERVER_AUTH_USER=mail_user
      - EMAIL_SERVER_AUTH_PASSWORD=mail_password
    networks:
      - habitica
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
  client:
    image: docker.io/awinterstein/habitica-client:latest
    depends_on:
      - server
    networks:
      - habitica
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  mongo:
    image: docker.io/mongo:5.0
    restart: unless-stopped
    command: ["--replSet", "rs", "--bind_ip_all", "--port", "27017"]
    healthcheck:
      test: echo "try { rs.status() } catch (err) { rs.initiate() }" | mongosh --port 27017 --quiet
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 30s
      start_period: 0s
      start_interval: 1s
      retries: 30
    networks:
      - habitica
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
networks:
  habitica:
    driver: bridge


```

## Optimized Setup with Docker Compose

As there's probably a web server running on the host already, acting as a reverse proxy for Habitica, this web server could be used to sever the static client files for Habitica as well.

```mermaid
architecture-beta
    group containers(server)[Containers]
    service db(database)[MongoDB] in containers
    service server(server)[Server] in containers
    db:L <-- R:server

    group host(server)[Host]
    service proxy(server)[Reverse Proxy] in host
    proxy{group}:T --> B:server{group}
    service client(database)[Client Files] in host
    proxy:R --> L:client
```

In this case, the client container (which also needs to run a web server inside), is not needed and the Docker Compose file could look like that:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  server:
    image: docker.io/awinterstein/habitica-server:latest
    depends_on:
      - mongo
    environment:
      - NODE_DB_URI=mongodb://mongo/habitica # this only needs to be adapted if using a separate database
      - BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 # change this to the URL under which your instance will be reachable
      - INVITE_ONLY=false # change to `true` after registration of initial users, to restrict further registrations
      - EMAIL_SERVER_URL=mail.example.com
      - EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=587
      - EMAIL_SERVER_AUTH_USER=mail_user
      - EMAIL_SERVER_AUTH_PASSWORD=mail_password
    networks:
      - habitica
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
  mongo:
    image: docker.io/mongo:5.0
    restart: unless-stopped
    command: ["--replSet", "rs", "--bind_ip_all", "--port", "27017"]
    healthcheck:
      test: echo "try { rs.status() } catch (err) { rs.initiate() }" | mongosh --port 27017 --quiet
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 30s
      start_period: 0s
      start_interval: 1s
      retries: 30
    networks:
      - habitica
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
networks:
  habitica:
    driver: bridge


```
